		<h2>Behavior as Search</h2>
		
		<p>What should you do when you try something, but it doesn't work?</p>

		<p>A lot of methods in reinforcement learning basically just involve performing random actions and hoping that something works, by luck. Once that happens, that randomly good behavior can be "reinforced" so that it will happen more often in similar circumstances.</p>

		<p>Now, without any kind of prior knowledge, it may seem that this is as good as you can do... but actually, there is a simple way we can do better. William James put it beautifully:  "nothing is more natural than that, when the easiest means of effecting [a] purpose prove fruitless, other means should be tried."</p>
		
		<p>In other words, if what you tried doesn't work, just try something else. But what should you try?</p>

		<p>The key is in the word "else". Obviously, you shouldn't do the exact same thing you just tried, which failed.... but how <i>different</i> should the next thing be?</p>

		<p>This is actually a question of <i>generalization</i>. If one behavior failed, how far should we generalize that failure to other "similar" behaviors?</p>

		<p><i>A priori</i>, we can't be sure how much we should generalize. If we assume we don't know anything, the safest bet may seem to be to not generalize at all.</p>

		<p>But, if we don't generalize at all, then we have to believe that a miniscule modification of our failed behavior is as likely to succeed as a distinctly different behavior!</p>

		<p>So, we should try to generalize... if we generalize a lot though, then we could make the mistake of over-generalizing, when actually a pretty similar behavior would have worked.</p>

		<p>The solution is to start off with a strong generalization (a bold guess!), try other very different behaviors, and only if those fail, "weaken" our initial guess.</p>
