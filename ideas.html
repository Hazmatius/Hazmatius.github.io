		<h2>Behavior as Search</h2>
		
		<p>What should you do when you try something, but it doesn't work?</p>

		<p>Obviously, you should try something else. William James put it beautifully, when he said that "nothing is more natural than that, when the easiest means of effecting [a] purpose prove fruitless, other means should be tried".</p>

		<p>But what should you try?</p>

		Reinforcement learning (RL) is a way of getting an <i>agent</i> to perform a <i>task</i>. There are several different ways of doing RL, but what they all have in common is that they learn very slowly, and 
		The dominant method of getting a machine to perform a task is reinforcement learning (RL), which treates the behavior of an agent as arising from a <i>policy</i> which can be <i>optimized</i> in order to maximize a <i>reward</i>. The main problems with RL is that it is incredibly inefficient, and it is incredibly brittle. That means that it takes a <i>lot</i> of time for an RL agent to learn how to do a task, and if you change the task even a little bit, the agent will totally flop and do something weird. I think the reason for this is fairly simple: optimizing a policy to maximize reward is not actually the right model of organic behavior!
