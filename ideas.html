		<h2>Behavior as Search</h2>
		
		<p>What should you do when you try something, but it doesn't work?</p>

		<p>A lot of methods in reinforcement learning basically just involve performing random actions and hoping that something works, by luck. Once that happens, that randomly good behavior can be "reinforced" so that it will happen more often in similar circumstances.</p>

		<p>Now, without any kind of prior knowledge, it may seem that this is as good as you can do... but actually, there is a simple way we can do better. William James put it beautifully:  "nothing is more natural than that, when the easiest means of effecting [a] purpose prove fruitless, other means should be tried."</p>
		
		<p>In other words, if what you do doesn't work, just try something else. But what?</p>
