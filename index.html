		<p>My name is Alex Baranski, I'm studying real-time problem-solving and behavioral adaptation as a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.oist.jp/">Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology</a>.</p>

		<p>I've developed a theory of behavioral search that explains how an agent can solve a problem it's never seen before. The theory relies on a method of constructing an infinite but countable set of goal-oriented behaviors. A behavior is a sequence of subgoals in a continuous state-space that you think you need to reach in order to accomplish your final goal. In thise sense, a behavior is also a hypothesis about how to solve a problem. In priciple, this infinite set contains every behavior: programming a computer, playing baseball, or navigating a maze. The infinite behavior-space is indexed by a cognitive graph, which when incrementally modified in the appropriate way, allows the agent to advance through behavior-space so that any behavior can be tried, if necessary. This guarantees that if a solution to the problem exists, it will eventually be found, as you long as you keep trying different things by enumerating the set. The enumeration (or search) is non-naive in the sense that the history of trials dynamically re-orders the rest of the search. I've written an algorithm for performing this search, and implemented it in a neural network based off of the hippocampus. If you are interested, read more about it <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01349">here</a>.</p>
